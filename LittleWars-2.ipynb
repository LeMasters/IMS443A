    "supple--by girls of the better sort, and by a few rare and gifted women.\n",

    "freshness--like spring. There was a Someone who fought Little Wars in\n",
    "the days of Queen Anne; a garden Napoleon. His game was inaccurately\n",
    "observed and insufficiently recorded by Laurence Sterne. It is clear\n",
    "that Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim were playing Little Wars on a scale\n",

    "and such-like appliances--a mere setting up and knocking down of men.\n",
    "Tin murder. The advance of civilisation has swept such rude contests\n",
    "altogether from the playroom. We know them no more...."

    "in our game is that known in England as the four-point-seven gun. It\n",
    "fires a wooden cylinder about an inch long, and has a screw adjustment\n",
    "for elevation and depression. It is an altogether elegant weapon.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was with one of these guns that the beginning of our war game was\n",
